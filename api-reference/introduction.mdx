## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.uptimeguard.xyz/v1
```

## Authentication

UptimeGuard API uses API keys for authentication. To use the API, you must include your API key in the Authorization header of each request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can generate and manage your API keys in the [UptimeGuard Dashboard](https://app.uptimeguard.xyz/settings/api-keys).

<Note>
  Keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly. If you believe an API key has been compromised, you can revoke it and generate a new one in your dashboard.
</Note>

## Rate Limiting

To ensure service stability, API requests are rate limited to 60 requests per minute per API key. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

The response headers will include information about your rate limit status:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 58
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1620000000
```

## Errors

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. In case of an error, the response body will include additional information:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_parameter",
    "message": "The URL parameter is invalid",
    "details": "The URL must be a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL"
  }
}
```

Common error codes include:

- `400 Bad Request` - The request was malformed or contained invalid parameters
- `401 Unauthorized` - Authentication failed, usually due to an invalid API key
- `403 Forbidden` - The API key doesn't have permission to perform the requested action
- `404 Not Found` - The requested resource doesn't exist
- `429 Too Many Requests` - Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Server Error` - An error occurred on our servers
